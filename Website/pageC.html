  The Alpha Builders would like to construct a website that contains COVID-19 Data from the following areas; Mitchell Shire, Hume, Yarra Ranges, Wyndham, Cardinia and the Morning Peninsula. Image taken from <a href= "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564</a>
</p>

<img src="assetts/images/wwwAbcNetAuNews20200707.jpg" alt="ABC News Corona Virus LockDown" class="center-img">

<p>
  These areas are in Victoria and the idea for the website is to have very quick, user friendly and informative information for people to help minimise COVID-19 for themselves and others around them in their local community. The website will be designed as a tool for people to use as a resource to get current data of COVID-19. Daily data from Melbourne and surrounding suburbs can be shown. COVID-19 new cases, current cases, deaths, recoveries and people in Intensive Care.
  <br>
  We can get data from this website (either dynamically or we can construct our own database for this exercise). <a href= "https://www.covid19data.com.au/">https://www.covid19data.com.au/</a>

<p>
  This website has national and Victorian categories.
  We can compare data on a national and state level looking at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmed cases today</li>
    <li>Confirmed cases yesterday</li>
    <li>Recoveries</li>
    <li>Deaths</li>
  </ul>
