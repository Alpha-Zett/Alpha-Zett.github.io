                This feature is used to display the real-time dynamics of covid-19 in Australia and other countries in the world. It will display six types of data: cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative cured cases, cumulative deaths, current confirmed cases, current cured cases, and current deaths.
                <br><br>
                Users can learn more about COVID-19 through this feature, whether for personal interests or because of their friends and family,

                <li> As a person interested in covid, I want to know how many people are currently diagnosed in Australia, so I logged in to MVF2 and checked the current confirmed cases.</li>
                <li> As a tourist who wants to travel to Japan, I want to know the covid status in Japan, so I went to the MVF2 page to check the current covid data in Japan.</li>
