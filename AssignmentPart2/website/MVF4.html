                A lot of people feel like COVID-19 is an endless rabbit hole. No one knows when it will end, and some people do not always trust the governments’ actions. Experts also need certain ways to predict the best measurements that the government can implement.
                <br> COVID-19 Trends allows the users to choose different measurements/no actions at all etc to see how the pandemic will last and how effective certain measurements can be. Users can also choose if a certain area has reduced a certain percentage (25%, 50% or 75%) of infected cases, how things will turn out. Thus, citizens would gain more trust with government actions and experts can also use this as a consideration when recommending government what actions to take.
                <br> For now, we decide to make the estimations based on the R0, population density and effectiveness of the measurements. R0 means patient zero, and it leads to a certain infection chain, for example, if R0 can infect 3 people based on high population density, every patient they infect can pass on the transmission onto another 3 patients. Let’s say if the government implements a lockdown, population density will be reduced, and the infection rate can be reduced let’s say from 3 down to 1 then the outcome will be totally different. These are just some basic ideas. Our algorithm can change as we implement the system.
