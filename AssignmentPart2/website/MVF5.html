      <h1 id="h1">Description</h1>
      The RSS Feed is a feed which will provide real-time updates about COVID-19 Victoria. There will be two feeds: A
      twitter feed which presents tweets from accounts like VicGovDHHS, COVID-19 Australia and COVID-19 Victoria; and
      another feed presenting articles from Official Government Websites such as DHHS Victoria.
      <br>
      We decided to implement this feature was we want to relay the important information to Victorians, at the right
      time. With several media platforms reporting updates about COVID-19, we wanted to help Victorians by creating a
      single platform where they can view daily updates about COVID-19 in Victoria.
      <br>
      Our group chose to create RSS Feeds to present daily updates because the feature can be automated and presented in
      a way which is easy to read and navigate. Alternative designs include News Wall, Carousel and List. The RSS Feed
      was chosen over these alternatives because: the news wall occupies too much space; the list lacks visuals and the
      carousel focus on one article at a time.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      The website will have a dedicated page for the two feeds. It will be presented as a vertical feed divided into
      assorted cards for each article. The Feeds will be created with RSS.app, a third-party application which is used
      to create RSS Feeds that presents articles from Twitter accounts or websites.

      <h1 id="h1">Validation</h1>
      This feature will be tested for validation by observing if the feeds output the relevant articles in chronological order, and updates in real-time. This will allow us to see if the RSS Feed updates in real time and is ordered from newest to older posts.
