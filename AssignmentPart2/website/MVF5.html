                The RSS Feed will provide real-time information about COVID-19 in Victoria. There will be two feeds: The twitter feed will present tweets from accounts such as VicGovDHHS, COVID-19 Australia, Victorian Government and COVID-19 Victoria. The other feed will present updates from Official Government Websites such as 
                <a href="https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/">DHHS Victoria</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.covid19data.com.au/">covid19data</a> and 
                <a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx">NSW Health Australia.</a>
                <br> Our group decided to implement this feature we believe it is important to keep Victorians with the right information at the right time. With many media platforms providing news about COVID-19, we wanted to simplify it by providing a single platform where they can view all real-time updates about COVID-19. This feature will be tested for validation by observing whether it shows articles from the expected sources and see if the feed updates minutes after the article being posted.
