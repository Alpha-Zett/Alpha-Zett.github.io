      The Regional RSS Feed is an extension to MVF5: RSS Feeds. These feeds will display news about COVID-19 in the municipalities of Victoria (e.g. Melbourne, Casey, Cardinia, Frankston, Greater Dandenong etc.),  the information will be sourced from websites ‘covidlive’ and ‘DHHS Victoria’. Our group decided to implement this as we wanted to help our users be informed about what is happening in their area.  
      <br>The website will have a dedicated HTML page for the Regional Feeds, where users can choose between different feeds based on the region. It will also have the same design as the main RSS Feed, but with different headings.
      <h1 id="h1">How are we going to build this?</h1>
      The Feeds will be created with RSS.app, a third-party application which is used to create RSS Feeds that presents articles from Twitter accounts or websites. This feature will be tested for validation with the same method as MVF5. This is to ensure that users have access to the vital information as soon as they are released.
