      <h1 id="h1">Description</h1>
      The chatbot will be an interactive entity which answers Victorians’ frequently asked questions about COVID-19. It
      will answer questions about cases, safety during the pandemic, business, information for health services and
      professionals, guidelines for service providers and specific questions about restrictions.
      <br>
      We decided to implement a Chatbot as we wanted to ensure Victorians are provided with the right information about
      staying safe and healthy during the pandemic, and avoid getting fined for doing the wrong thing. Though our
      website is primarily a data tracker, we also believe that it is important to show Victorians how they can stay
      safe during the pandemic and know where they can reach out to.
      <br>
      Our group chose to present the FAQ as a Chatbot as it provides our users with a more interactive and comprehensive
      way of finding information about COVID-19. We also chose this design because it is a unique way of answering
      users’ questions and is also very easy to use and access.

      <h1>How does it work?</h1>
      The interaction between the chatbot and user will be made up of inputting multiple-choice answers and outputting
      answers in text boxes. This will be created with tidio.com, a third-party application which creates interactive
      chatbots that can be implemented onto websites. The diagram below shows the interaction between the user and chatbot, and how users will get their answers.

      <h1 id="h1">Validation</h1>
      This feature will be tested for validation by observing if the inputted answers lead to the relevant outputs and
      answers the questions thoroughly. For example: If a user inputs “Staying Safe during the pandemic”, we want the
      chatbot to output information about “How to stay Safe”, “What are the symptoms” and “Where you can get tested”.
      <br>
      The main objective of the Chatbot is to provide the right answers to the user’s queries. Hence, the focus of the
      validation testing is to see if the chatbot outputs the correct information.
