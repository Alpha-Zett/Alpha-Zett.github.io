                The chatbot will be used to answer people’s frequently asked questions about COVID-19. Some areas that the chatbot will cover are: ‘About COVID-19’, ‘Staying Safe from COVID-19’, ‘Testing’ and ‘Restrictions’. All the information will be sourced from Government websites such as Health NSW and Department of Health and Human Services.
                <br> We decided to implement this feature on our website to help Victorians understand what COVID-19 is and what can be done during restriction periods. The purpose of the chatbot is to provide Victorians with an interactive and comprehensive tool, which can quickly answer their questions about COVID-19 in Victoria. This feature will be tested for validation by inputting questions and key words and see if the chatbot outputs the expected answers or provides relevant links.
