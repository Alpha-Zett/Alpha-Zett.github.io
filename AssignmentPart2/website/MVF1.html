                <p>The interactive Map as the homepage of our project to show users visual data of people affected by covid-19 in Victoria. We also use different color levels to indicate the extent to which different areas are affected by covid-19. After that, users can use the search function in the upper right corner to search for specific areas to view related data. 
                   <br>

                    <br> We download the csv data from the official Victoria website, then we integrate it through Microsoft Excel Worksheet, then upload the csv file to the third-party map generation page (BatchGeo). Finally embed the map link in our html.
                 <br>

                    <br> Two charts are created below the interactive map. The purpose of this is that users can more intuitively combine the map to observe the data.
