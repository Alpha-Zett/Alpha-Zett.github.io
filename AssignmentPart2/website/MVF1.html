                There will be a map of Victoria that will have user input where someone can select their postcode and the amounts of COVID-19 with a 5km radius of the inputted postcode will show COVID-19 cases by the use of coloured spheres that pop up in the postcode and surrounding post codes. These spheres will change in intensity and/or size to represent COVID-19 cases in numbers. The higher the number of cases, the larger and denser the sphere around that particular post code.
                <br> We will gather data from government sources which will be accurate and up to date and research to see if we have the option to feed data directly into the map or if we have to create our own database.
                <br> The purpose of having the interactive map with COVID-19 cases is so that a user can open the website and quickly get information about COVID that is around them and see it in a graphic form.
