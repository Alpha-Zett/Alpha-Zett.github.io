                <p>The interactive Map as the homepage of our project to show users visual data of people affected by covid-19 in Victoria. We also use different color levels to indicate the extent to which different areas are affected by covid-19. After that, users can use the search function in the upper right corner to search for specific areas to view related data. 
                   <br>

                    <br> We download the csv data from the official Victoria website, then we integrate it through Microsoft Excel Worksheet, then upload the csv file to the third-party map generation page (BatchGeo). Finally embed the map link in our html.
                 <br>

                    <br> Two charts are created below the interactive map. The purpose of this is that users can more intuitively combine the map to observe the data.
                
                <br>
                <h2><Evf3 part (Testing Facility Locations)</h2> 
                The reason for establishing this feature is to bring better interactive experience to users. First, set the address of each testing facility as a primariy key, then upload the csv file to the third-party map generation page (BatchGeo) . In this feature, the user can click on each mark to find the test location.

                        As an uber driver, I can check which areas are more infected, so I can try to avoid entering those areas

                        The figure below shows the different colors indicating the extent of the impact of covid-19 in different regions. For example, red indicates the highest level. The range is 768-2143. The division is based on the percentage of the total number of people.

                    <p>
                        We also need to display the relevant data of this place when the user clicks on one of the markers.When we switch the display data from the lower left corner, we also need to regenerate the color grade to represent new cases today

                    We import the csv file into a third-party web page, which can help us automatically generate the charts below, then edit and embed the obtained histogram into the html file.When the user moves the mouse to the chart, the current data will be displayed
