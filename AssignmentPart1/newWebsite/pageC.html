<!--Project Description-->
<p id="subheading">What is it?</p>
<p>
  The Alpha Builders would like to construct a website that contains COVID-19 Data from the following areas; Mitchell Shire, Hume, Yarra Ranges, Wyndham, Cardinia and the Morning Peninsula. Image taken from <a href= "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564</a>
</p>
<img src="assets/images/abcNewsCoronaVirusLockDown.png" alt="abcNewsCoronaVirusLockDown">
<p>
  These areas are in Victoria and the idea for the website is to have very quick, user friendly and informative information for people to help minimise COVID-19 for themselves and others around them in their local community. The website will be designed as a tool for people to use as a resource to get current data of COVID-19. Daily data from Melbourne and surrounding suburbs can be shown. COVID-19 new cases, current cases, deaths, recoveries and people in Intensive Care.
  <br>
  We can get data from this website (either dynamically or we can construct our own database for this exercise). <a href= "https://www.covid19data.com.au/">https://www.covid19data.com.au/</a>
  <br>
  This website has national and Victorian categories.
  We can compare data on a national and state level looking at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmed cases today</li>
    <li>Confirmed cases yesterday</li>
    <li>Recoveries</li>
    <li>Deaths</li>
  </ul> 
<p>
    This information can be captured in several ways. We can have a small summary of data available at the top of the screen or window. This information can be shown in graph form and this would either be on its own page of corresponding data or be placed further down on the home page. This can evolve through more developing the content of the site as a group. Here is a link on embedding interactive COVID-19 maps, but may not be as local as the website requires.

 <h2>Heading</h2>
 <p>We consider common problems that may be encountered.The main goal of the function is to allow users to more intuitively observe the changes in daily data.This is an extension for our interactive map.</p>

 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
      What is it This feature will be used to present data that cannot be shown on the table. Here, we can show the total number of cases, total number of deaths, amount of people tested, amount of active cases, recoveries etc. This set of data will be updated daily, like our interactive map. We can present this in the form of a graph, or just a table even. <br>
      Use what-if statements to make judgments and feedback data
     </li>
     <li>
       Steps: <br>
       1:We set the variables we need through javascript  <br>
       2:According to the percentage change, we use different colors to indicate different levels <br>
       3:We will estimate whether the virus will bring more cases and the possible end date based on changes in daily data <br>
       4:We set up a table and a pie chart, this purpose can intuitively let users understand the degree of harm of the situation, for example, red represents crisis, green represents safety <br>

       <img src="assets/images/MFV2.PNG" alt="">
      </li>

   </ul>
 </p>

 <h2>Purpose</h2>
 <p>
  The purpose is to express that the interactive map cannot represent the information data. We create a pie chart or a data map through different colors to allow users to more intuitively observe information such as changes in the number of infections and deaths in different regions. At the same time, it can give users a trend of virus case changes.
 </p>
 <h2>User Stories</h2>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
      As a student, I want to know if there are any infection cases near my campus, so that I can consider whether to apply for online classes
     </li>
     <li>
      As an Uber driver, I can know which area is severely affected by COVID-19, so that I can avoid driving there
     </li>
     <li>
      As a reporter, I can know the daily number of infections across the country, so I can organize reports and publish
     </li>
   </ul>

<h2>MVF4 COVID-19 Trend</h2>
<p id="subheading">Description</p>
<p>
  A lot of people feel like COVID-19 is an endless rabbit hole. No one knows when it will end, and some people do not always trust the governments’ actions. Experts also need certain ways to predict the best measurements that the government can implement. 
  <br> COVID-19 Trends allows the users to choose different measurements/no actions at all etc to see how the pandemic will last and how effective certain measurements can be. Users can also choose if a certain area has reduced a certain percentage (25%, 50% or 75%) of infected cases, how things will turn out. Thus, citizens would gain more trust with government actions and experts can also use this as a consideration when recommending government what actions to take. 
  <br> For now, we decide to make the estimations based on the R0, population density and effectiveness of the measurements. R0 means patient zero, and it leads to a certain infection chain, for example, if R0 can infect 3 people based on high population density, every patient they infect can pass on the transmission onto another 3 patients. Let’s say if the government implements a lockdown, population density will be reduced, and the infection rate can be reduced let’s say from 3 down to 1 then the outcome will be totally different. These are just some basic ideas. Our algorithm can change as we implement the system.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Arisa Sonohara is a university student who is depressed about the current COVID-19 situation as she has no idea when the pandemic will end and she’s unsure if the new restrictions can improve the future. Thus, she can use COVID-19 Trend to make predictions for the future. Once she sees some estimated outcomes, she feels more relieved and more confident with life. 
    </li>
    <li>
      James Whistler is a health expert working in the Australian Department of Health and he wants to give advices to the Australian government of what actions to take based on the current situation of COVID-19. COVID-19 Trend can help him decide with more reliable and useful ideas for the government.
