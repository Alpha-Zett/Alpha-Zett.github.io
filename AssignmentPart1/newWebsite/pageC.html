<p id="subheading">What is it?</p>
<p>
  The Alpha Builders would like to construct a website that contains COVID-19 Data from the following areas; Mitchell Shire, Hume, Yarra Ranges, Wyndham, Cardinia and the Morning Peninsula. Image taken from <a href= "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564">https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-07/metropolitan-melbourne-suburbs-back-in-coronavirus-lockdown/12431564</a>
</p>
<img src="assets/images/abcNewsCoronaVirusLockDown.png" alt="abcNewsCoronaVirusLockDown">
<p>
  These areas are in Victoria and the idea for the website is to have very quick, user friendly and informative information for people to help minimise COVID-19 for themselves and others around them in their local community. The website will be designed as a tool for people to use as a resource to get current data of COVID-19. Daily data from Melbourne and surrounding suburbs can be shown. COVID-19 new cases, current cases, deaths, recoveries and people in Intensive Care.
  <br>
  We can get data from this website (either dynamically or we can construct our own database for this exercise). <a href= "https://www.covid19data.com.au/">https://www.covid19data.com.au/</a>
  <br>
  This website has national and Victorian categories.
  We can compare data on a national and state level looking at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirmed cases today</li>
    <li>Confirmed cases yesterday</li>
    <li>Recoveries</li>
    <li>Deaths</li>
  </ul> 
<p>
    This information can be captured in several ways. We can have a small summary of data available at the top of the screen or window. This information can be shown in graph form and this would either be on its own page of corresponding data or be placed further down on the home page. This can evolve through more developing the content of the site as a group. Here is a link on embedding interactive COVID-19 maps, but may not be as local as the website requires.

<h2>Features</h2>
<p id="subheading">Minimum Viable Feature 1: Interactive Map</p>
<p id="subheading">Minimum Viable Feature 2: Extra Data</p>
    <article>
 <h2>Heading</h2>
 <p>We consider common problems that may be encountered.The main goal of the function is to allow users to more intuitively observe the changes in daily data.This is an extension for our interactive map.</p>

 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
      What is it This feature will be used to present data that cannot be shown on the table. Here, we can show the total number of cases, total number of deaths, amount of people tested, amount of active cases, recoveries etc. This set of data will be updated daily, like our interactive map. We can present this in the form of a graph, or just a table even. <br>
      Use what-if statements to make judgments and feedback data
     </li>
     <li>
       Steps: <br>
       1:We set the variables we need through javascript  <br>
       2:According to the percentage change, we use different colors to indicate different levels <br>
       3:We will estimate whether the virus will bring more cases and the possible end date based on changes in daily data <br>
       4:We set up a table and a pie chart, this purpose can intuitively let users understand the degree of harm of the situation, for example, red represents crisis, green represents safety <br>

       <img src="2.PNG" alt="">
      </li>

   </ul>
 </p>
 <br>

 <h3>Purpose</h3>
 <p>
  The purpose is to express that the interactive map cannot represent the information data. We create a pie chart or a data map through different colors to allow users to more intuitively observe information such as changes in the number of infections and deaths in different regions. At the same time, it can give users a trend of virus case changes.
 </p>
 <h2>User Stories</h2>
 <p>
   <ul>
     <li>
      As a student, I want to know if there are any infection cases near my campus, so that I can consider whether to apply for online classes
     </li>
     <li>
      As an Uber driver, I can know which area is severely affected by COVID-19, so that I can avoid driving there
     </li>
     <li>
      As a reporter, I can know the daily number of infections across the country, so I can organize reports and publish
     </li>
   </ul>
