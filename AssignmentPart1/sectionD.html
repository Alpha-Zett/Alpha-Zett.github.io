 <h2>Group Contract</h2>
 
    <h3>Ground Rules</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>
            Attend as many meetings as possible
           </li>
           <p>If you cannot make it, please message the group at least 24 hours beforehand. </p>
           <li>Our group will host 1~2 meetings per week. </li>
           <p>
            Monday afternoon – Reflect on tasks completed the previous week and planning what is to come ahead 
           </p>
           <p>
            Friday mornings – Update each other on progress made throughout the week and any questions or concerns that need to be clarified. 
           </p>
           <li>Our group will communicate each other at least once a day via Microsoft Teams. We will update each other on micro-tasks accomplished, and/or ask questions or concerns about their tasks. We will also use this platform to help each other in case</li>
           <li>Everyone in the group will respect each other.</li>
           <li>Everyone will always their best. </li>
        </ul>  
   <h3>Dealing with setbacks and/or unmet expectations </h3>
   <ul>
       <li>
        We will try to deal with the setback and/or unmet expectations by communicating with the team through Microsoft Teams. 
       </li>
       <li>
        If the group cannot solve it ourselves, we will ask our mentor for guidance and suggestions for ways to solve the issue. 
       </li>
       Our team will regularly communicate their progress. Doing so will allow everyone to identify any potential problems that may affect progress or the outcome of the project.        
   </ul>
   <h3>Providing feedback </h3>
   <ul>
       <li>
        We will do our best to have at least 2 to 4 members of the group read through our parts, before finalizing it. 
       </li>
       <li>
        When giving feedback, we will provide critical feedback and suggest ways in which they can improve their parts. 
       </li>
       <li>
        The tasks do not have to be “almost complete” before asking for feedback. Everyone can ask feedback about anything at any reasonable time during the project. (e.g. Asking for feedback about an approach before commencing.) 
       </li>
       <li>
        Make sure ask for feedback at least 24-48 hours before the agreed deadline.
       </li>
   </ul>
