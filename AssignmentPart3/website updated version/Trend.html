            <h1 id="h1">Introduction</h1>
            As governments around the world implement different ways to counter the virus, most citizens do not fully
            understand the reasons behind government actions or unsure of whether their actions are reliable or not.
            COVID-19 Trend allows you to make predictions on future pandemic of Victoria based on the restrictions you
            choose. Of
            course, there are other factors that can affect the outcomes:
            <ul>
                <li>Date in which the restrictions take place
                    <br>Different dates have different numbers of active cases and daily increases in the last few days
                    etc. Thus, the date could mean how serious the infection is.
                </li>
                <li>Duration of restrictions
                    <br>It’s obvious that the longer the duration of restrictions stay in place, the safer everyone is.
                    However, these measurements cannot last forever as the country needs to keep the economy running and
                    people need to work to make a living. So, balancing the safety and economy is very important. If the
                    restrictions do not last long enough, the number of cases can bounce back and ruin the previous
                    measurements that everyone worked hard for.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Obviously, the predicted outcome cannot be 100% accurate as there are many other factors that are impossible
            to be accurately taken into account, such as not everyone will obey the measurements, it could be 5%, 10% or
            different, no one knows. We are assuming “95% of people obeying the restrictions” to make the calculations.
            Population density can be different near every household which can also somewhat affect the outcome of
            prediction.
            <h1 id="h1">Brief guide on the system</h1>
            You can choose one of the two waves of the outbreaks in Victoria to make a prediction. The first wave
            happened in March and the second wave happened in July. If you choose the first wave, the system would
            calculate based on the data from 16th March. If you choose the second wave, the system would calculate based
            on the data from 9th July.
            <br>You can then choose the restrictions but it is not required. If no restrictions
            are chosen, the system would calculate with no restrictions taking place to combat the virus. Of course, you
            can choose both restrictions as well.
            <br>There are three options for time after the restrictions take place, each option can lead to a different
            outcome.
            <br>The outcome of the prediction shows the number of new cases after the chosen time after the restrictions
            take place with a brief reason as to why. To give you a comparison, the number of new cases on 16th March
            (first wave) was 16 and the number of new cases on 9th July (second wave) was 143. For more details of the
            cases in Victoria please visit: <a href = "https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/victorian-coronavirus-covid-19-data?fbclid=IwAR05xqBdZd0nwchIjQOxdPYHBkuhWgIVI8USA0OGsoAWM8XzAzhuJSWgLpQ">https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/victorian-coronavirus-covid-19-data?fbclid=IwAR05xqBdZd0nwchIjQOxdPYHBkuhWgIVI8USA0OGsoAWM8XzAzhuJSWgLpQ</a>
