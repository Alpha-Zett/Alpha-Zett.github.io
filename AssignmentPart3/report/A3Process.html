                        This project has taught me many things about group projects - how to properly plan projects and
                        how the
                        principles of Agile Ways of Working are applied to projects. <br><br>

                        <b>Planning Projects</b> <br>
                        This project taught me how to define objectives, responsibilities and milestones during the
                        early stages of
                        the project. These are really important as establishing these correctly can help the team work
                        efficiently
                        and keep everyone focused on the main goal. <br><br>

                        <b>Agile Ways of Working</b> <br>
                        Throughout this project, I focused on encouraging open communication, simplicity and using
                        working software
                        as the primary measure of progress. This taught me how communication can help improve the
                        efficiency and
                        team dynamic and how emphasizing on simplicity makes the complicated aspects of the project
                        easier to
                        understand. I also learnt how using working software as the primary measure of progress helps
                        the team focus
                        on developing tangible deliverables.
                        <br><br>

                        <b>Adapting to Change</b> <br>
                        This project also taught me how things can change, and the importance of embracing these
                        changes. I learnt
                        how these changes can be an opportunity for everyone to learn something new, to create products
                        in different
                        ways we did not know was possible or identify other ways we can deliver value to users.

                        <hr>

                        <b>Feedback</b> <br>
                        I used the feedback from my peers and teachers to improve on my individual parts. The feedback I
                        received
                        throughout this project often were: expanding on certain areas, making parts clearer, using the
                        correct
                        notations and applying the right concepts. I also used this feedback as a learning experience
                        for future
                        projects.
                        <br><br>

                        <b>Communication</b> <br>
                        For the majority of the project, our team used Microsoft Teams and GitHub as our platforms for
                        communications. It worked out for the most part - we hosted regular meetings, we discussed
                        questions and
                        concerns we had and occasionally communicated each other’s progress. However, it was difficult
                        to keep track
                        of everyone’s progress with Microsoft Teams alone. Our team started using Trello more frequently
                        in the
                        later stages - which made it much easier to keep track of the tasks that need to be done, that
                        are in
                        progress and that have been accomplished.

                        <b>Most important aspect of carrying out a project like this</b> <br>
                        Like most projects, I strongly believe that good teamwork is the most important aspect of
                        carrying out a
                        project like this. As this project involves creating multiple features to deliver value to
                        users, teams must
                        be able to work together to ensure that the team is achieving milestones to the expected
                        standard whilst
                        meeting the deadlines.
                        <br><br>

                        <b>My advice</b> <br>
                        If groups were to embark on a similar project to this, I would highly recommend them to put more
                        emphasis on
                        planning. Making sure that you have a clear picture about what the end product and its features
                        are going to
                        look like, and the key milestones that need to be achieved. I would also advise the team to
                        communicate with
                        each other frequently, as the features rely on each other to make the whole product work well.

                        <b>Things learned in group project</b>
                        <p>
                            I have learned more about how to communicate with the group better and making schedules with the group to make sure things go as much as possible according to plan and finish them before deadlines. For the first two parts of the assignment we had missed quite a few things in assignment details which was mainly due to not getting familiar with the details and end up forgetting parts. 
                        </p>
                        <b>Mentor/Lecturer</b>
                        <p>
                            We have asked questions about our MVFs and System Context Diagram to get feedback from the mentor. The lecturer helped me understand how important Trello is and the group expectations. As well as how SparkPlus can affect individual marks. 
                        </p>
                        <b>Communication</b>
                        <p>
                            We’ve allocated tasks every week during the meetings and used Trello to keep work up to date. Compared to the start of the semester, we now work more collaboratively with each other. Members are more open to give help to others when they experience difficulties. 
                        </p>
                        <b>Important aspect</b>
                        <p>
                            The most important aspect is to make sure every member in the group understands every part of the project so that suggestions and advice can be more accurate and reliable. Also, if a group member experiences issues, others can help out more easily as they also have a good understanding of that person’s part. If I was to start again, I would make sure I get a full understanding of the project so that I’m ready to help/explain the project to others and I would also ask my group to do the same. 
                        </p>
                        <b>Advice</b>
                        <p>
                            I would advise them to read assignment details carefully and make a template at the start so that every section can be covered to avoid missing parts of the assignment. Having only one or two people fully read the details can still miss one or two things here and there. I would also suggest them to study other group members’ roles and project details so that they can help out when necessary.
                        </p>

            help to identify key issues,achieve high marks and works better in the
            future industry. <br><br>

            <b>Discipline Knowledge</b> <br>
            I learn a lot, especially web programming technology, coding skills like
            HTML,CSS ,GitHub, AWS and Plugin ins.And also GitHub for commit my write ups and outcomes to my project.
            In addition, New Collaboration technology, I mean Trello Microsoft Teams and Spark plus as
            well.And also Lucid chart and Figma to prototype my idea and show my context structure and flow
            chart. <br><br>

            <b>Correctly applies all the key knowledge requirements for the required
              task. Can identify the most appropriate concepts, principles and methods</b> <br>
            I am always using improved web programming skills to make our One stop Covid 19
            info tracker center better and easier for my users. Here is evidence to show what I code
            for our project. I am also the man who collaborate everything into AWS by myself and
            submit all the assignment.
            <br><br>

            <b>Identify the most appropriate concepts, principles and
              methods to be used to design and develop IT systems.</b> <br>
              During the semester, I also learn the project scope is very imp ortant, know the project schedule is
              also necessary , know how to be a project lea der , know how to plan a project since the
              beginning and Agile ways of working through the Micro credential.
            <br><br>

            <b>Teamwork</b> <br>
            I think I am a functioning team member . I obey my team's contract all the time.
            Since the start of Microsoft Teams chat, I never miss any online group meeting. And I
            proactively communicate with my group members to share ideas and outcomes, and
            discuss feedbacks.
            <br><br>

            <b>Communication</b> <br>
            Then I consistently improve my idea and show improved ideas with other members
            through group chat and meetings. Moreover, each week before stand up, I will upload
            last week's outcomes to Trello, absolutely before the deadline I set.
            <br><br>

            <b>Insightful evaluation of peer work with all key issues outlined and solid
              constructive feedback</b> <br>
              As I mentioned before, I help Yuxiang not only database, but also
              Timeline from week 3 to week 12 structure plan for the whole team.
            <br><br>

            <b>My key feedback</b> <br>
            For the assignment part 3, team members said we lose marks for part2.
            And I suppose an idea called Final checking list.I also provide useful tips for team members according to the assignment's rubric 
            to make sure everyone in the right direction.What's more, I make use of my own experience and Dr.B's guide to teach
            other members how to use AWS educate step by step.

                        Before the establishment of the project, we conducted video communication through the MS team,

                        and determined plans.After that, we assigned each task. When the task is completed, we will
                        deliver the
                        project to trello to let the team track the progress and give feedback.Before the final delivery
                        of the
                        project, we will also test the project. If we find any problems, we will discuss and improve

                            well?</b><br>

                        The main thing that I learned about group projects through Alpha Builders this semester is the
                        importance of having regular team meetings to make sure everyone is on the same page, tasks have
                        been allocated accordingly, the progress of the project can be monitored and assessed and having
                        excellent time management skills. We had scheduled meetings but around the holidays we did not
                        have meetings and it was interesting to see how the project did not progress as much when the
                        team was not getting together. This was only for a week and we got back into having regular
                        meetings for the rest of the semester. Upon reflection, we did OK for our first assignment but
                        did not do so well for our second assignment, so for myself, I created a System Context Diagram
                        but I did not take everything on board that Ivan had recommended from our tutorial, so even
                        though I do try to take Ivan's suggestions on board with our work, this small mistake assisted
                        in our group not getting as good a mark. Alpha Builders and myself have tried to address our
                        assignment 2 issues within assignment 3 and I feel that in doing so, we have come together
                        collectively to work through these issues. So, what may not have worked so well helped us in the
                        preparation for assignment 3.<br><br>

                        <b>What use did you make of your mentor and lecturer in guiding you?</b>
                        Ivan and Dr B are excellent resources of information. We had weekly access to Ivan during our
                        tutorials where each group would present what they had done each week. Ivan would critique
                        everyone’s work. This was great as we could gain lots of knowledge quickly. We did not meet up
                        with Dr B on a weekly basis, but he is always accessible via email. When our group was first
                        formed and we were trying to flesh out our ideas for the project, I emailed Dr B about extra
                        features that we could include in our project and this started a discussion about providing
                        features that need to add value to users and Dr B made some suggestions that we included in our
                        project. We would not have been able to get the initial approval from Ivan without the help form
                        Dr B and we would not have been able to progress without the weekly feedback and critiquing from
                        Ivan.<br><br>

                        <b>Processes for communication? How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the
                            start of the semester?</b><br>

                        We have been using Microsoft teams for our main method of communication. This is how we chat and
                        hold meetings and we have had group and individual meetings with Ivan and Dr b thought teams.
                        Teams has been a great platform. I was initially getting all alerts but had changed some setting
                        in another class - not realising that I wasn't getting all message through. Once I figured this
                        out, I changed the setting back and was able to have constant communication with everyone again.
                        Teams with the right alert setting is very effective as you are always accessible and if you
                        have a question for the group, you can post in onto Microsoft teams. As mentioned above, meeting
                        are a very important element of communication and holding meetings through Microsoft Teams easy
                        to set up and the team knows what is going on.<br><br>

                        <b>What do you think is the most important aspect of organising a project of this
                            nature?</b><br>
                        You need to have great communication between all participants and everyone needs to have the
                        ability to work collaboratively and we have the tools to do this during this COVID time where we
                        can use Microsoft Teams for communication and chat, Trello for setting up, allocating and
                        marking off tasks and github to be able to upload files, download from the repository and build
                        things together.<br><br>
