                        <td>Two more newly acquired skills are Bootstrap for web pages and the use of JavaScript. Once
                            the second
                            version of the prototype had been finalised through Figma, the next stage of this
                            development was to
                            create HTML web pages, with CSS. We had just been taught Bootstrap, so I was eager to
                            implement this new
                            feature into the prototype website. I had great difficulty adding full page images using
                            Bootstrap. This
                            is quite strange as I ended up using Bootstrap extensively for another assignment using full
                            page videos,
                            but I was initially having trouble getting this work. As time is so precious in this course,
                            I chose to
                            abandon that and work only with HTML and CSS. Using this method, I was able to replicate the
                            design
                            concept from the Figma prototype.<br><br>
                            Another newly acquired skill is the ability to use JavaScript to increase functionality of
                            websites. There
                            are sections in the homepage of the COVID-19 website that I wanted to have the ability to
                            minimise or pop
                            out from a small panel, expanding into a larger panel. When working on this, I was able to
                            get the
                            animations to work well, but once I had finished what I was working on and refreshed the
                            webpage, while
                            the animations do work, the initial states are in the wrong positions - the panels are
                            opened instead of
                            closed. I believe I will be able to amend this but my priorities at the moment have been on
                            writing
                            sections of the assignment.

            <section>
                <h1 id="h1">Plans change</h1>
                Several changes were made to our initial plan:

                <h3>Features</h3>
                We started with five minimum viable features: Interactive Map, Case presentation, Chatbot, COVID-19
                Trend and
                RSS Feed. As our project progressed, our team decided to implement some changes to deliver more value to
                the
                end-users. As a result, minimum viable feature two is now ‘Contact Tracing’ and we came up with three
                extended
                features: Regional RSS Feeds, COVID Cases Presentation and Testing Facility Locations.

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                The team initially planned to create a prototype website and have it tested with 12 ~ 15 unique users.
                We did
                not have much time to conduct proper testing because some features were more difficult to develop and
                therefore
                took longer than expected. To overcome this, our group had all our features tested individually with
                different
                users.
            </section>

            <!--Timetable-->
            <section>
                <h1 id="h1">Timetable realistic?</h1>
                Our initial timetable was realistic for the most part. The timetable was constructed based on a logical
                progression and allocated reasonable times for the planning, research and designing phases. However,
                there are
                several changes that we would make knowing what we know now.

                <h3>Development and Testing</h3>
                The timetable we created for the development and testing phases were vague, which resulted in the team
                spending
                more time on the development phase and conducting a small number of tests. We would improve this by
                defining
                deadlines for micro-goals leading up to the full development of the features. Doing so can help the team
                work
                more efficiently, and allow time for the team to cross-check each other’s features to see if they are
                meeting
                expectations and provide feedback for improvement. It will also allow more time for testing, which gives
                the
                team the opportunity to further improve on the products, and learn more things.

                <h3>Assignments</h3>
                The timetable for assignments was also vague, which resulted in the team making inconsistent progress
                throughout
                the weeks and leaving tasks to the last week. We think that this can be improved by breaking down
                assignments to
                smaller tasks and aim to complete some tasks each week. This can help improve our work efficiency as our
                members
                are not overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be accomplished.

                <h1 id="h1">Tools and Technologies</h1>
                The Tools and Technologies we used worked out for the most part. However, there were some that did not
                work out
                as expected:

                <h3>Adobe XD</h3>
                <p>Matthew initially used Adobe XD as he had access to it and wanted to see if it were easier to work
                    with using
                    native Adobe files, and wanted to test out what the preview of the prototype was like and more
                    importantly how
                    the final preview is generated and to see how usable this is in the sense of being able to add
                    iframe code
                    into
                    a HTML page to incorporate into an assignment submission. This exercise is comparing this software
                    with the
                    software that I started to learn in the previous semester - Figma.</p>
                <p>It was an interesting exercise to carry out as his initial assumptions were that Adobe XD would be
                    easier to
                    use, more precise and would have realistic animations and transitions to recreate convincing user
                    experiences
                    from the prototype environment.</p>
                <p>What I found is that it was more clunky to use, even though it had very similar workflows, Figma was
                    easier
                    to
                    use, it felt smoother to build up the pages, handled all types of files similarly and had superior
                    animations
                    or
                    transitions that could be carried out quickly.</p>

            <!--Risks-->
            <section>
                Our group was able to monitor and minimize some of the risks identified in
                <a href="https://alpha-zett.github.io/AssignmentPart1/newWebsite/pageC.html">Assignment 1</a>.
                However, some of the identified risks materialized during the project:

                <table id="t01">
                    <th>Risk</th>
                    <th>What we did to address the risk</th>

                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            “Scope creep may occur. This occurs when an uncontrolled change is made to the project’s
                            scope”
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            We addressed this by discussing the changes that resulted from scope creep, and what we
                            wanted to do to
                            address the change.
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>“Some members may not be understand[ing] the set-tasks”</td>
                        <td>
                            We addressed this by hosting regular meetings to answer everyone’s questions relating to the
                            set tasks. We
                            also discussed the tasks in detail, and established the things that need to be done.
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            “Tasks may not be accomplished within the agreed date”
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            We attempted to address this by communicating our issues with each other, and worked
                            together to come up
                            with a solution.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
