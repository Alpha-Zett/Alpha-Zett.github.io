      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of this website is driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 on Victorians today. The pandemic has
        caused many Victorians to feel confused and overwhelmed with the many changes and events that took place.
        Here,
        we want to create a platform where we provide Victorians with the right information, at the right time about
        COVID-19. Doing so will allow us to show Victorians how they can keep their loved ones and themselves safe and
        stay informed about what is happening around them.
      </p>

        <h2>Aim and Goals</h2>
        <h3>Aim</h3>
        <p>
          Our group aims to help Victorians stay safe during the pandemic. We intend to do so by providing real-time
          data
          about active COVID-19 cases in Victoria, showcasing risk levels of people around them and providing updates
          about restrictions and rules. This can help with contact tracing and provide opportunities for citizens and
          the
          Government to take proactive and reactive measures, which can minimize the virus spread and help citizens
          stay
          positive and healthy during a difficult and confusing time.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Keeping people informed about COVID-19 in Victoria. We intend to achieve this through the Chatbot and RSS
            Feeds, which will be used to deliver the latest information about the current rules and regulations, and
            daily
            news about COVID-19. We believe that this will help Victorians as they can use this information to take
            proactive measures to keep their families and friends safe, and also prepare for events that may occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an easily accessible platform for most data relating to COVID-19 in Victoria. We intend to achieve
            this
            by creating a website hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), as we want our website to be accessible to as
            many
            people as possible. We also aim to create our website as user friendly as possible, so users of all ages
            and
            backgrounds can easily read and understand the information presented to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping people informed about COVID-19 within their suburbs. As COVID-19 affects suburbs across Victoria
            differently, we want to make sure that Victorians know what is happening around in their area. Providing
            this
            information can help Victorians take more precaution areas close to them and help them find their nearest
            testing facility.
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Our project objective is to create a functional website that provides real-time information about COVID-19
          in
          Victoria, and updates about regulations and restrictions relating to COVID-19. The deliverables are the
          minimum
          viable features: Interactive Map, Contact Tracing, Chatbot, COVID-19 Trend and RSS Feed; and the extended
          features: Regional RSS Feeds, COVID Cases presentations and testing facility locations.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Milestones</h3>

          Week 6-9: Complete feature and website designs
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Week 10: Complete feature prototypes
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Week 11: Conduct testing and implement necessary changes
        </ul>
        <ul>
