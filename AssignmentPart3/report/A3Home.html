                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea of this website is driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 on Victorians today. The pandemic has
                    caused many Victorians to feel confused and overwhelmed with the many changes and events that took place.
                    Here, we want to create a platform where we provide Victorians with the right information, at the right time about
                    COVID-19. Doing so will allow us to show Victorians how they can keep their loved ones and themselves safe and
                    stay informed about what is happening around them.
                </p>

                    <h4>Interest in Topic</h4>
                    As a person who tries to live through the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, I think it is important to be able to
                    have access to as much COVID-19 information as possible. This is vital, not just for me but for everyone to
                    have as much knowledge about the virus to help reduce infection rates and hopefully eradicating it one day.
                    Melbourne had a high rate of daily infections and sadly has had 794 deaths since COVID-19 entered Australia.
                    While Melbourne was the worst affected by COVID-19 in Australia, the total number of global COVID-19 deaths is
                    monumentally tragic at 1,033,511. Covid-19 is real and we have to learn to live differently and that is my
                    motivation and interest in this topic. It is scary, but it is better to equip people with knowledge so that
                    everyone can get through the day as safely as possible. Everyone needs to be on the same page, and everyone
                    must understand how fatal COVID-19 is, and everyone needs to work together to reduce cases, not just locally
                    but globally too.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Existing design skills</li>
                        <li>User Centred Design skills from semester 1</li>
                        <li>Fundamental programming</li>
                        <li>Previous experience with working with teams from semester 1 and previous work roles</li>

                    <h4>Skills after Project</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A much better understanding of Trello (based on Kanban Board) and how tasks can be assigned and
                            completed and has complete transparency to the whole team.
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            An excellent understanding of Microsoft Teams and how teams can work collaboratively through teams, via
                            meetings and sharing information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A better understanding of Figma and having the ability to compare this online application with Adobe XD
                            (as I had access to this application). It was good to test this out to see which one worked better and Figma was
                            easier to use and produce a much better preview which can be easily embedded into our web-based
                            assignments.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I have had some experience in presenting which is honestly not my favourite thing to do, but it is always good
                            to gain further practice and experience in this area. I hope to be able to do a better job at presenting
                            for the assignment 3 presentation (after completing Presenting Using Story).
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            I hope to have a better idea in Agile ways of working and Planning projects through this course.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Improved HTML and CSS developed further from Introduction to Technology.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A much better understanding of Github and working collaboratively through Github.

                    <ul>
                       <li>
                            Wrote up a draft project description. Research on finding COVID-19 data from local sources - sites like covid19data.com.au - assisted in RSS
                            feed research and Twitter Feeds, creating interactive maps using mapbox and similar websites that already exist - https://covidvictoria.com/
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Got content together and uploaded onto Github for Assignment 1 - Section C
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created the viCOVID-19 logo and first/second drafts of a colour pallet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As mentioned before, I assisted in the research for MVF1, but Yuxiang had it covered so I did not need to
                            proceed with this. I assisted in helping Yuxiang with EVF3 and as this was an extension of the interactive
                            map, again he had it covered and done quickly. I helped in creating an architectural diagram for this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created basic wireframes for assignment 1
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            Assignment 1 - wrote up 'What" section to the first user story section.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Created initial System Context Diagram which was developed further with the group.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Initial prototype on Adobe XD and final prototype on Figma.
                            Will use this to carry out user testing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Initial work on website converting prototype into HTML and CSS and some jQuery too. This is still in progress
                            but will work on more after getting more of the reporting done.
                        </li>

                <p>
                    Our group aims to help Victorians stay safe during the pandemic. We intend to do so by providing real-time data
                    about active COVID-19 cases in Victoria, showcasing risk levels of people around them and providing updates
                    about restrictions and rules. This can help with contact tracing and provide opportunities for citizens and the
                    Government to take proactive and reactive measures, which can minimize the virus spread and help citizens stay
                    positive and healthy during a difficult and confusing time.
                </p>

                        <li>
                            Keeping people informed about COVID-19 in Victoria. We intend to achieve this through the Chatbot and RSS
                            Feeds, which will be used to deliver the latest information about the current rules and regulations, and
                            daily news about COVID-19. We believe that this will help Victorians as they can use this information to take
                            proactive measures to keep their families and friends safe, and also prepare for events that may occur.

                        <li>
                            Create an easily accessible platform for most data relating to COVID-19 in Victoria. We intend to achieve
                            this by creating a website hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), as we want our website to be accessible to as
                            many people as possible. We also aim to create our website as user friendly as possible, so users of all ages
                            and backgrounds can easily read and understand the information presented to them.

                            Keeping people informed about COVID-19 within their suburbs. As COVID-19 affects suburbs across Victoria
                            differently, we want to make sure that Victorians know what is happening around in their area. Providing
                            this information can help Victorians take more precaution areas close to them and help them find their nearest
                            testing facility.

                <p>
                    Our project objective is to create a functional website that provides real-time information about COVID-19
                    in Victoria, and updates about regulations and restrictions relating to COVID-19. The deliverables are the
                    minimum viable features: Interactive Map, Contact Tracing, Chatbot, COVID-19 Trend and RSS Feed; and the extended
                    features: Regional RSS Feeds, COVID Cases presentations and testing facility locations.
