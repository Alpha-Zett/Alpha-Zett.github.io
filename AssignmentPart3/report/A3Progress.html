        <h4>How it began</h4>
        The project began as one of several proposed ideas that was brought forward at the first Alpha Builders team
        meeting. The idea originated as having an interactive map to view COVID-19 cases in selected areas around
        Melbourne and greater Victoria. Everyone from Alpha Builders decided to work on a project involving gathering
        data about COVID-19 within the Victorian region and to set up an interface where it was easy for people to
        access information about COVID-19 in the area they live and surrounding suburbs. This project is important to us
        all as we are living through the COVID-19 pandemic and it is something that we are directly impacted by. In the
        COVID-19 environment it is good to have as many resources as possible to help inform, educate and keep people up
        to date with related news and COVID-19 data. Our project aims to create something that is like a one stop shop
        for COVID-19 news and resources.

        <h4>How it progressed</h4>
        The project evolved with the help of Dr. B and Ivan Sun, who assisted us in exploring other ways data could be
        put onto a website so that there is more "added value" for users coming to a COVID-19 website. The first version
        of MVFs were MVF1 Interactive Map, MVF2 COVID-19 Cases Presentation, MVF3 Chatbot, MVF4 COVID-19 Trend and MVF5
        RSS Feeds and an initial EVF1 of Personalised Data on an RSS feed. MVF1 was established quickly. MVF 2 evolved
        into Contact Tracing, MVF 3 was established quickly, MVF 4 concept idea was solidified and RSS Feed has evolved
        into Social Feeds like local COVID-19 Twitter feeds. The EVFs further evolved into three, with EVF 1 Regional
        RSS Feeds, EVF 2 COVID-19 Cases Presentation and EVF 3 Testing Facility Locations.

        <h4>How our project progressed compared to our plan</h4>
        Alpha Builders have been using Trello for the duration of the course and as such, everything that has been
        uploaded to Trello can be looked back on accurately, as everything has time stamps and is categorised.

        <h4>Changes</h4>
        The initial concept which was developed from Assignment 1 is a project that " The Alpha Builders would like to
        construct a website that contains COVID-19 Data from the following areas; Mitchell Shire, Hume, Yarra Ranges,
        Wyndham, Cardinia and the Morning Peninsula." These regions are the areas that surround the Melbourne CBD area,
        and these were the areas that went into lockdown." The interactive map that was developed for Assignment 2 has a
        greater search area, giving results for the entire state of Victoria. So, this is one example of the initial
        concept changing.

        <h4>MVF1 Interactive Map - Things that went according to plan (PUT THIS IN PROGRESS)</h4>
        The Interactive map concept stayed true to the original idea, but the search area that was created was much
        broader than originally designed and anticipated. The initial zones where closer to the CBD and surrounding
        suburbs, but Yuxiang built a search area that covered Victoria - which is great. It was more than what the group
        had initially proposed. There is a search bar at the top of the page which allows users to enter a post code and
        then get results within that radial area. There is a drop-down button at the bottom which shows "Total cases"
        and it can also show the other option is "New cases today". The coloured markers change accordingly to
        correspond with the selected drop-down option. Users have existing map functionality like zooming in and out,
        panning, selecting between "Satellite" and "Map" views. <br>(Insert Image)

        <h4>Things that did not go according to plan</h4>
        Reshuffling of some MVFs and EVFs.<br>
        The below diagram shows Alpha Builders the first version of the MVF's, the second version of the MVFs and the
        EVFs. From this image, the Interactive Map stayed as MVF1, MVF2 was originally COVID Cases Presentation which
        became Contact Tracing. MVF3 stayed as the Chatbot. MVF4 stayed as COVID-19 Trend and MVF5 stayed as RSS Feed.
        One other change to note is that the EVF2 was initially Contact Tracing but that was swapped with the original
        MVF2. These changes were made after being discussed as a team where team members were identifying certain MVFs
        as more challenging and proposing some reshuffling to occur. <br>(Insert Image)
        <p>Here are two ideas that were in the original line up to see if they could be approved for the first round of
          ideas that were presented to Dr. B. and Ivan Sun. The first idea is a COVID-19 forum style discussion board.
          This idea was discouraged as this feature can be implemented dynamically in the form of a Chatbot.</p>
        <p>The next idea was to have a "Health Code" within their mobile devices. This idea initially did not get
          developed as an MVF but possibly going to be used for an EVF. As shown in the previous image, this idea was
          not pursued further.</p>
        <p>The images below show the different stages of development of the viCOVID-19 website, ranging from the initial
          wireframes to the first version of the viCOVID-19 website which was done in Adobe XD (as opposed to Figma for
          the second version). From these images it can be seen that the logo has been consistently shown on the top
          left-hand side and the navigation section is on the top. There is a section underneath the logo called "quick
          data" which was an idea to have information identifying total confirmed cases, total active cases and new
          cases in the last 24 hours. The chatbot section appears on the right-hand side but has the panel popping out
          from the right-hand side. This evolved to having the panel pop out in a downwards direction from a tab located
          under the navigation bar on the right-hand side. The wire frame diagrams show the news feed located directly
          underneath the navigation section towards the top of the page. This was shown on Microsoft Teams and discussed
          with a suggestion to move the news feed to the left-hand side of the screen. This can be seen as a small dark
          grey tab at the bottom of the page. This will pop up from the bottom of the screen in an upwards direction.
          The number of pages on the website and the page titles are the same at this stage.
          <br>(Insert Image)
        </p>
        <p>The images above show the different page setups for the viCOVID-19 website proposal. This version was built
          using Figma as it gives a better interactive preview that can be easily added to web pages for assignment
          purposes, so that a working prototype can be easily demonstrated.</p>
        <p>The number of pages change at this stage and the names of some of them change to accommodate the evolving
          MVFs and EVFs. As discussed previously, the FAQs page have been replaced with Trend Forecasting on the third
          page and Contact Tracing on an additional fourth page. The home page has a photo taken in the Footscray area
          showing a message from a shop in the inner western area of Melbourne. This is a snapshot of the reality of how
          some small to medium businesses are trying to survive through the economic effects of COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, Alpha builders decided that it was not necessary to have the quick data on the pages as this is
          like repeated information from the map page, which is generating similar information, so the smaller
          information panel located underneath the logo in the top right-hand corner. This clears up the space and makes
          the area more user friendly and less cluttered. <br>(Insert image)
        </p>
        <p>Everyone's MVFs have been incorporated into the prototype layout. The RSS/Social feed and chatbot positions
          have not changed and remain on the home page. The interactive map with the combined "Testing Facility"
          locations for EVF3 are included. See below how the "Testing Facility" has been constructed with scrolling for
          locations.<br>(Insert Image)</p>
        <p>In summary, the project has evolved into a website and the main five features will be a RSS Feed section, a
          chatbot section, an interactive map with a search bar for postcode searches and a drop down toggle button to
          show "Total cases" in an area and "New cases today". There is a trend forecast page where a user can enter
          their location, a start date and selectable restrictions via checkboxes with slider controls for the amount of
          days for restrictions and the predictions. The last feature is to have contact tracing where people will need
          to register their details and then be able to login. Details of a user's health will assist in generating data
          to potentially show individual user data in their immediate area. The EVFs are the Regional RSS Feeds, COVID
          Cases Presentation and Testing Facility Locations.

        <h3>MVF1 - Interactive Map</h3>
        The original idea was to complete the MFV1 part by calling Google API to generate an interactive map. In the
        process of learning, I found a third-party plug-in called BatchGeo, which can automatically generate various
        maps by importing CSV files. After that, only layout settings and functional debugging are needed to complete
        our original idea. However, estimation is not “over generous”, because sufficient time is spent on both learning
        BatchGeo and integrating resource CSV. To be honest, MVF1 took more time than the original estimate time because
        we also developed other functional charts, databases and servers.
        
        
        <h3>MVF3 - Chatbot</h3>
        The original idea was to complete the MFV3 part by web programming and 
        database to generate an interactive Chatbot. In the process of learning, 
        I found a third-party platform plug-in called Tidio, which can 
        automatically generate Chatbot by importing embedded link. 
        After that, what I need to do is creating interactive Q&A ,
        managing them in the system and collaborating it into our project website.
         Estimated time is about according to the schedule, because sufficient 
         time is spent on researching suitable platform and integrating the 
         logic of Q&A.

         <h3>MVF5 - RSS Feed</h3>
         The original idea was to complete the MFV5 part by web programming , 
         especially JavaScript to generate a RSS feed for users. 
         In the process of learning, I found it is not hard to embedded RSS 
         into my project, which can automatically generate RSS feed block 
         by importing embedded link. After that, what I need to do is creating 
         personalized RSS feed and collaborating it into our project website. 
         Estimated time is about according to the schedule, because sufficient 
         time is spent on researching suitable platform and integrating the 
         layout between RSS and project website.

        The scope of our project has changed throughout the duration of the project. Some of these changes are:

        <h3>Testing</h3>
        The team initially planned to create a prototype website and have it tested with 12 ~ 15 unique users. We did
        not have much time to conduct proper testing because some features were more difficult to develop and therefore
        took longer than expected. To overcome this, our group had all our features tested individually with different
        users.

        <h3>EF1 incomplete</h3>
        We were not able to develop the Regional RSS Feeds as we found it difficult creating an RSS Feed which can
        automatically output articles from other websites that do not already have an RSS Feed.

        <h1 id="h1">Testing</h1>
        <p>Ramon conducted a user-testing with a university student for the Chatbot and RSS Feed. This has resulted in
          some changes – Renaming ‘Cases’ to ‘Restrictions’, improving the clarity of the questions and answers, added a
          new category ‘Help’ and reduced the amount of questions answered.</p>

        <p>Yuxiang conducted user-testing with a student from RMIT university. We learned through feedback after the
          test that some texts were garbled and some typos were also found. We
          will modify and improve these texts, but the overall test is very smooth, and no major BUG problems have
          appeared. Regarding time, if we have enough time, we will integrate all the web pages and send them to people
          in many different fields for testing and feedback. We would get results from people of different ages and
          different occupations, this may make our project more perfect.</p>

        <h3>Plans for testing</h3>
        Our plans for testing had changed throughout the project. Initially, our group aimed to conduct testing with 2~3
        users on our prototype website. We ended up testing the features individually with # unique users as we did not
        have enough time.

        <h3>Our advice</h3>
        We encourage groups to allocate a time for testing with users and conduct it despite having some components
        unfinished. This can be very beneficial as feedback from users can identify whether the features successfully
        fulfill its intended purpose, identify ways it can be improved to be more user-friendly and draw inspiration for
        alternative solutions that can be implemented. We also recommend doing this as early as possible to allow time
        for implementing changes.
