                <h2>How it began</h2>
                The project began as one of several proposed ideas that was brought forward at the first Alpha Builders
                team
                meeting. The idea originated as having an interactive map to view COVID-19 cases in selected areas
                around
                Melbourne and greater Victoria. Everyone from Alpha Builders decided to work on a project involving
                gathering
                data about COVID-19 within the Victorian region and to set up an interface where it was easy for people
                to
                access information about COVID-19 in the area they live and surrounding suburbs. This project is
                important to us
                all as we are living through the COVID-19 pandemic and it is something that we are directly impacted by.
                In the
                COVID-19 environment it is good to have as many resources as possible to help inform, educate and keep
                people up
                to date with related news and COVID-19 data. Our project aims to create something that is like a one
                stop shop
                for COVID-19 news and resources.

                <h2>How it progressed</h2>
                The project evolved with the help of Dr. B and Ivan Sun, who assisted us in exploring other ways data
                could be
                put onto a website so that there is more "added value" for users coming to a COVID-19 website. The first
                version
                of MVFs were MVF1 Interactive Map, MVF2 COVID-19 Cases Presentation, MVF3 Chatbot, MVF4 COVID-19 Trend
                and MVF5
                RSS Feeds and an initial EVF1 of Personalised Data on an RSS feed. MVF1 was established quickly. MVF 2
                evolved
                into Contact Tracing, MVF 3 was established quickly, MVF 4 concept idea was solidified and RSS Feed has
                evolved
                into Social Feeds like local COVID-19 Twitter feeds. The EVFs further evolved into three, with EVF 1
                Regional
                RSS Feeds, EVF 2 COVID-19 Cases Presentation and EVF 3 Testing Facility Locations.

                <h2>How our project progressed compared to our plan</h2>
                Alpha Builders have been using Trello for the duration of the course and as such, everything that has
                been
                uploaded to Trello can be looked back on accurately, as everything has time stamps and is categorised.

                <h2>Changes</h2>
                The initial concept which was developed from Assignment 1 is a project that " The Alpha Builders would
                like to
                construct a website that contains COVID-19 Data from the following areas; Mitchell Shire, Hume, Yarra
                Ranges,
                Wyndham, Cardinia and the Morning Peninsula." These regions are the areas that surround the Melbourne
                CBD area,
                and these were the areas that went into lockdown." The interactive map that was developed for Assignment
                2 has a
                greater search area, giving results for the entire state of Victoria. So, this is one example of the
                initial
                concept changing.

                <h2>MVF1 Interactive Map - Things that went according to plan (PUT THIS IN PROGRESS)</h2>
                The Interactive map concept stayed true to the original idea, but the search area that was created was
                much
                broader than originally designed and anticipated. The initial zones where closer to the CBD and
                surrounding
                suburbs, but Yuxiang built a search area that covered Victoria - which is great. It was more than what
                the group
                had initially proposed. There is a search bar at the top of the page which allows users to enter a post
                code and
                then get results within that radial area. There is a drop-down button at the bottom which shows "Total
                cases"
                and it can also show the other option is "New cases today". The coloured markers change accordingly to
                correspond with the selected drop-down option. Users have existing map functionality like zooming in and
                out,
                panning, selecting between "Satellite" and "Map" views. <br>(Insert Image)

                <h2>Things that did not go according to plan</h2>
                Reshuffling of some MVFs and EVFs.<br>
                The below diagram shows Alpha Builders the first version of the MVF's, the second version of the MVFs
                and the
                EVFs. From this image, the Interactive Map stayed as MVF1, MVF2 was originally COVID Cases Presentation
                which
                became Contact Tracing. MVF3 stayed as the Chatbot. MVF4 stayed as COVID-19 Trend and MVF5 stayed as RSS
                Feed.
                One other change to note is that the EVF2 was initially Contact Tracing but that was swapped with the
                original
                MVF2. These changes were made after being discussed as a team where team members were identifying
                certain MVFs
                as more challenging and proposing some reshuffling to occur. <br>(Insert Image)
                <p>Here are two ideas that were in the original line up to see if they could be approved for the first
                    round of
                    ideas that were presented to Dr. B. and Ivan Sun. The first idea is a COVID-19 forum style
                    discussion board.
                    This idea was discouraged as this feature can be implemented dynamically in the form of a Chatbot.
                </p>
                <p>The next idea was to have a "Health Code" within their mobile devices. This idea initially did not
                    get
                    developed as an MVF but possibly going to be used for an EVF. As shown in the previous image, this
                    idea was
                    not pursued further.</p>
                <p>The images below show the different stages of development of the viCOVID-19 website, ranging from the
                    initial
                    wireframes to the first version of the viCOVID-19 website which was done in Adobe XD (as opposed to
                    Figma for
                    the second version). From these images it can be seen that the logo has been consistently shown on
                    the top
                    left-hand side and the navigation section is on the top. There is a section underneath the logo
                    called "quick
                    data" which was an idea to have information identifying total confirmed cases, total active cases
                    and new
                    cases in the last 24 hours. The chatbot section appears on the right-hand side but has the panel
                    popping out
                    from the right-hand side. This evolved to having the panel pop out in a downwards direction from a
                    tab located
                    under the navigation bar on the right-hand side. The wire frame diagrams show the news feed located
                    directly
                    underneath the navigation section towards the top of the page. This was shown on Microsoft Teams and
                    discussed
                    with a suggestion to move the news feed to the left-hand side of the screen. This can be seen as a
                    small dark
                    grey tab at the bottom of the page. This will pop up from the bottom of the screen in an upwards
                    direction.
                    The number of pages on the website and the page titles are the same at this stage.

                </p>
                <p>The images above show the different page setups for the viCOVID-19 website proposal. This version was
                    built
                    using Figma as it gives a better interactive preview that can be easily added to web pages for
                    assignment
                    purposes, so that a working prototype can be easily demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The number of pages change at this stage and the names of some of them change to accommodate the
                    evolving
                    MVFs and EVFs. As discussed previously, the FAQs page have been replaced with Trend Forecasting on
                    the third
                    page and Contact Tracing on an additional fourth page. The home page has a photo taken in the
                    Footscray area
                    showing a message from a shop in the inner western area of Melbourne. This is a snapshot of the
                    reality of how
                    some small to medium businesses are trying to survive through the economic effects of COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, Alpha builders decided that it was not necessary to have the quick data on the pages as
                    this is
                    like repeated information from the map page, which is generating similar information, so the smaller
                    information panel located underneath the logo in the top right-hand corner. This clears up the space
                    and makes
                    the area more user friendly and less cluttered. <br>(Insert image)
                </p>
                <p>Everyone's MVFs have been incorporated into the prototype layout. The RSS/Social feed and chatbot
                    positions
                    have not changed and remain on the home page. The interactive map with the combined "Testing
                    Facility"
                    locations for EVF3 are included. See below how the "Testing Facility" has been constructed with
                    scrolling for
                    locations.<br>(Insert Image)</p>
                <p>In summary, the project has evolved into a website and the main five features will be a RSS Feed
                    section, a
                    chatbot section, an interactive map with a search bar for postcode searches and a drop down toggle
                    button to
                    show "Total cases" in an area and "New cases today". There is a trend forecast page where a user can
                    enter
                    their location, a start date and selectable restrictions via checkboxes with slider controls for the
                    amount of
                    days for restrictions and the predictions. The last feature is to have contact tracing where people
                    will need
                    to register their details and then be able to login. Details of a user's health will assist in
                    generating data
                    to potentially show individual user data in their immediate area. The EVFs are the Regional RSS
                    Feeds, COVID
                    Cases Presentation and Testing Facility Locations.

                The Contact Tracing can show the user the risk levels of people around so that the user knows what kind
                of people he/she is in close contact with. Red means high risk/confirmed case, yellow means maybe in
                risk of infection, and green means safe and healthy. However, we originally planned to make a
                login/register feature which would make more sense as all the other people shown on the map are users,
                and the users fill out information to let the system decide their risk levels, but we weren't able to
                implement this in the given time frame.

                    The Trend Forecast will be able to demonstrate the predictions of first and second waves of the
                    outbreak in Victoria based on user inputs. The output will be the number of new cases after the prediction with a brief reason why. The original plan was to allow users to choose a location
                    (city in Australia), a date with more than two restrictions. However, it was found out that there
                    would be way too many possible outcomes and it was impossible to come up with a way to calculate
                    every single one of them in the given time frame. So, in order to simplify the feature, I have
                    decided to only make the predictions in Victoria. The dates option was changed to which wave of the
                    outbreak to choose from (first wave was in March and second is in July). The restrictions were
                    reduced to two and the number of days after the restrictions take place was changed from 2-365 days
                    to 2 weeks, 1 month or 2 months.

                    <h2>MVF1 - Interactive Map</h2>
                    The original idea was to complete the MFV1 part by calling Google API to generate an interactive
                    map. In
                    the
                    process of learning, I found a third-party plug-in called BatchGeo, which can automatically generate
                    various
                    maps by importing CSV files. After that, only layout settings and functional debugging are needed to
                    complete
                    our original idea. However, estimation is not “over generous”, because sufficient time is spent on
                    both
                    learning
                    BatchGeo and integrating resource CSV. To be honest, MVF1 took more time than the original estimate
                    time
                    because
                    we also developed other functional charts, databases and servers.

                    <h2>MVF2 - Contact Tracing</h2>
                    The quicker way to achieve the aspect of this feature was obviously to seek help from Yuxiang who’s
                    very good at making the map using Batchgeo which he did for MVF1. I had struggled with implementing
                    the map for this feature for 2 weeks but Yuxiang was able to help me out and it was done overnight.
                    As most people had thought, the implementation part takes a lot longer than expected so pushing
                    forward the timeline would’ve been ideal.

                    <h2>MVF3 - Chatbot</h2>
                    The original idea was to complete the MVF3 part by web programming and
                    database to generate an interactive Chatbot. In the process of learning,
                    I found a third-party platform plug-in called Tidio, which can
                    automatically generate Chatbot by importing embedded link.
                    After that, what I need to do is creating interactive Q&A ,
                    managing them in the system and collaborating it into our project website.
                    Estimated time is about according to the schedule, because sufficient
                    time is spent on researching suitable platform and integrating the
                    logic of Q&A.

                    <h2>MVF4 - Trend Forecast</h2>
                    The estimation plan had pushed things a bit too much to the end. Although the plan was based on
                    deadlines of assignments, there was very limited time to make this feature for the final system
                    which led to simplifying the feature into a much simpler version and a lot of the initial ideas had
                    to be removed.
                    Unfortunately, I have not discovered a quicker way to achieve the aspect of this feature. However,
                    if I was to do this again, I would give myself 2 weeks extra to implement it which means finishing
                    assignment part 2, 2 weeks earlier.

                    <h2>MVF5 - RSS Feed</h2>
                    The original idea was to complete the MVF5 part by web programming ,
                    especially JavaScript to generate a RSS feed for users.
                    In the process of learning, I found it is not hard to embedded RSS
                    into my project, which can automatically generate RSS feed block
                    by importing embedded link. After that, what I need to do is creating
                    personalized RSS feed and collaborating it into our project website.
                    Estimated time is about according to the schedule, because sufficient
                    time is spent on researching suitable platform and integrating the
                    layout between RSS and project website.

                    the covid-19 test in Victoria. Regarding location and working hours data, we grabbed them from the
                    official Victoria website. Regarding the production method, first download the data to the local
                    directory, then use Microsoft excel to organize and export the csv format, then use a third-party
                    software ( batchgeo) to generate a map, and finally embed the generated map link into mvf1. When the
                    user uses this function, if the user wants to find the test location closest to them, they only need
                    to find the test location closest to them through the map, and then click the mark in the map. After
                    that, detailed information about the place, such as address and business hours, will be displayed
                    above the marker on the map.

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    The team initially planned to create a prototype website and have it tested with 12 ~ 15 unique
                    users.
                    We did
                    not have much time to conduct proper testing because some features were more difficult to develop
                    and
                    therefore
                    took longer than expected. To overcome this, our group had all our features tested individually with
                    different
                    users.

                    <h2>EVF1 incomplete</h2>
                    We were not able to develop the Regional RSS Feeds as we found it difficult creating an RSS Feed
                    which
                    can
                    automatically output articles from other websites that do not already have an RSS Feed.

                    <p>Ramon conducted a user-testing with a university student for the Chatbot and RSS Feed. This has
                        resulted in
                        some changes – Renaming ‘Cases’ to ‘Restrictions’, improving the clarity of the questions and
                        answers, added a
                        new category ‘Help’ and reduced the amount of questions answered.</p>

                    <p>Yuxiang conducted user-testing with a student from RMIT university. We learned through feedback
                        after
                        the
                        test that some texts were garbled and some typos were also found. We
                        will modify and improve these texts, but the overall test is very smooth, and no major BUG
                        problems
                        have
                        appeared. Regarding time, if we have enough time, we will integrate all the web pages and send
                        them
                        to people
                        in many different fields for testing and feedback. We would get results from people of different
                        ages and
                        different occupations, this may make our project more perfect.</p>

                    <h2>Plans for testing</h2>
                    Our plans for testing had changed throughout the project. Initially, our group aimed to conduct
                    testing
                    with 2~3
                    users on our prototype website. We ended up testing the features individually with # unique users as
                    we
                    did not
                    have enough time.

                    <h2>Our advice</h2>
                    We encourage groups to allocate a time for testing with users and conduct it despite having some
                    components
                    unfinished. This can be very beneficial as feedback from users can identify whether the features
                    successfully
                    fulfill its intended purpose, identify ways it can be improved to be more user-friendly and draw
                    inspiration for
                    alternative solutions that can be implemented. We also recommend doing this as early as possible to
                    allow time
                    for implementing changes.
